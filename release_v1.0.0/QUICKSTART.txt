  PreBootRepair v1.0.0 - Quick Start Guide

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
PreBootRepair schedules disk repairs that run BEFORE Windows boots,
similar to how CHKDSK runs at startup when Windows detects issues.

----------
1. Right-click PreBootRepair.exe -> Run as Administrator
2. Select your drive (usually C:)
3. Choose a repair mode:
   - Basic: Quick scan using dirty bit
   - Standard: Full CHKDSK /R (recommended)
   - Advanced: CHKDSK + SFC + DISM (most thorough)
4. Click "Schedule Repair"
5. Reboot when ready
